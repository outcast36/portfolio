# My portfolio
Purpose: Rather than linking my GitHub profile and expecting employers to scour my repos, I made this portfolio to showcase my projects and creativity in a more inviting and trustworthy manner. 

# TODO
* Come up with a theme and overall design
* Figure out how to structure a section for a single project
* Actually finish some projects
* Write some JavaScript to make cool animations for highlights and project showcases
* Structure intro card
* Write up short bio for about me
* Get a domain so this is not just a github.io page?
